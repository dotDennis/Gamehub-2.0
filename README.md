# GameHub

After a ton of idea sketching, head scratching & late nights..
My very first website is on it's way.

The layout was first sketched on several solid, yet ice-cold paper pieces. Eventually I was satisfied with the layout, and started forming the design. Took a while, but I got there eventually.

Then... the enourmous task of putting it into Adobe XD began.
Well, it wasn't really an enourmous task, but it was something new, and challenging - something I hadn't done before.
It turned out fine after a few late eye-scratching nights.

Finally got to relax a bit - with some Web & Communication Technology assignments.

And then I got here. To the point of no-return & coding.

*smock* I'll keep you posted! :heart:
